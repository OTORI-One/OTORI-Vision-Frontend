<think>The user wants to create a realistic trading experience for their advisors testing the OTORI Vision Token (OVT) prototype. Let's break down the requirements:

1. Connect a wallet - This is likely already implemented with their current wallet integration
2. Buy OVT with Bitcoin - This would involve real Bitcoin transactions on signet
3. See OVT price increase due to portfolio positions - This requires:
   - Mock portfolio positions with random growth/shrinkage
   - Overall positive trajectory
   - Occasional significant spikes
4. Sell OVT for Bitcoin - Again real transactions
5. Potentially mint a real "rune" on signet as the OVT token

Let me first explore more of the codebase to understand what's already implemented before creating a task list.

First, let's check if there's a wallet integration:</think># OTORI Vision Token Enhancement Plan

I'm definitely up for this challenge! Let's create a realistic trading experience for your advisors with the hybrid approach you described. Before diving into specific tasks, let me explore more of your codebase to understand what's already implemented.

After reviewing your codebase, I have a clear picture of what's already implemented and what needs enhancement. Let me now create a comprehensive plan to implement the experience you're looking for.

## OTORI Vision Token Experience Enhancement Plan

### Overview of Current Status

1. **Wallet Integration**: Already implemented using `useLaserEyes` for wallet connection
2. **Buy/Sell OVT Functions**: Basic implementation exists in `archClient.ts` and `useTradingModule.ts`  
3. **Portfolio Simulation**: Basic random fluctuation exists (Â±2%) but lacks the sophisticated patterns you want
4. **Rune Support**: Scripts for etching and minting OVT runes on signet are available

### Enhancement Plan

I'll organize this into concrete tasks that we can track together:

## Phase 1: Portfolio Growth Dynamics (2-3 days)

### Task 1.1: Implement Sophisticated Price Movement Algorithm
```javascript
// Create an advanced price movement algorithm with:
// - Overall positive trend (+5-10% monthly)
// - Daily fluctuations (-3% to +5%)
// - Weekly cycles with weekend trends
// - Random "super spikes" (+15-25%) every 5-14 days
```

### Task 1.2: Enhance Position Fluctuation Logic
```javascript
// Use the PositionClient class to store growth patterns
// - Track last spike date
// - Implement volatility profiles per position
// - Add position correlation factors
```

### Task 1.3: Hybrid Mode Portfolio Visualization
```javascript
// Enhance NAVVisualization to:
// - Display trendlines more attractively
// - Show portfolio growth metrics
// - Implement "hot sector" indicators
```

## Phase 2: OVT Token Integration with Signet (3-5 days)

### Task 2.1: Implement OVT Rune on Signet
```javascript
// Use the existing rune scripts to:
// - Etch the OVT rune on signet
// - Link the rune to wallet addresses
// - Set up proper transaction processing
```

### Task 2.2: OVT Buy Flow Enhancement
```javascript
// Create a seamless buy experience:
// - Integrate real Bitcoin transactions
// - Display processing status for transactions
// - Securely record ownership in rune metadata
```

### Task 2.3: OVT Sell Flow Enhancement
```javascript
// Implement a secure sell workflow:
// - Allow selling OVT for Bitcoin
// - Track transaction status
// - Update portfolio balances
```

## Phase 3: Real-time Data Integration (2-3 days)

### Task 3.1: Bitcoin Price Integration
```javascript
// Enhance useBitcoinPrice hook to:
// - Fetch real-time Bitcoin prices
// - Implement proper caching
// - Add error handling with fallbacks
```

### Task 3.2: Portfolio Price Impact
```javascript
// Make portfolio growth influenced by:
// - Real Bitcoin price movements
// - Time-based growth patterns
// - "Special events" for spikes
```

### Task 3.3: Hybrid Analytics Dashboard
```javascript
// Create analytics showing:
// - Portfolio growth vs. Bitcoin performance
// - OVT token price trends
// - Projected growth patterns
```

## Phase 4: User Experience Refinement (2-3 days)

### Task 4.1: Wallet Transaction History
```javascript
// Show complete transaction history:
// - Real Bitcoin transactions
// - OVT token purchases/sales
// - Portfolio growth events
```

### Task 4.2: Price Movement Indicators
```javascript
// Add real-time indicators:
// - Price movement alerts
// - Growth trend highlighting
// - Special event notifications
```

### Task 4.3: Admin Visibility Controls
```javascript
// Create admin controls to:
// - Trigger growth spikes
// - Adjust growth parameters
// - Monitor system health
```

## Suggested First Steps

Let's start with the most impactful tasks:

1. **Implement the sophisticated price movement algorithm** (Task 1.1)
2. **Set up the OVT rune on signet** (Task 2.1)
3. **Enhance the OVT buy flow** (Task 2.2)
