### 2025-03-17: Migrating from Nested Directory Structure

Today we restructured our deployment to use a cleaner, more maintainable architecture:

#### Previous Structure
```
OTORI-Vision-Frontend/
└── ovt-fund/
    ├── components/
    ├── pages/
    ├── src/
    └── ... (all application code)
```

#### Current Structure
```
OTORI-Vision-Frontend/
├── components/
├── pages/
├── src/
└── ... (all application code directly in the root)
```

#### Benefits of This Change
1. **Simplified Paths** - All imports and file references are now more straightforward
2. **Better Build Consistency** - The build process now works from the correct root directory
3. **Reduced Complexity** - Eliminated nested package management that was causing conflicts
4. **Improved PM2 Integration** - Service now runs from the correct directory with proper access to build artifacts

#### Implementation Details
- PM2 service was previously running from the nested directory (`/home/otori-pi/OTORI-Vision-Frontend/ovt-fund`)
- Now running from the repository root (`/home/otori-pi/OTORI-Vision-Frontend`)
- Resolved "502 Bad Gateway" errors caused by mismatched build and runtime directories
- Fixed TypeScript module scoping issues that were causing build failures

#### Future Improvements
- Consider adding comprehensive build and deployment scripts
- Implement proper environment switching for different deployment targets
- Add CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and deployment process
