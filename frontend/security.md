# Security Analysis and Vulnerability Management

## Current Vulnerabilities

### Next.js 13.5.10
- Currently using an older version of Next.js which has known security vulnerabilities
- Upgrading to Next.js 15.x is planned (see migration plan below)

### Dependencies
- Some dependencies from @omnisat/lasereyes ecosystem may have nested vulnerabilities
- Axios in the dependency tree may have security concerns that need regular updates

## Next.js 15.x Migration Plan

### Rationale
1. **Security:** Next.js 15 addresses critical vulnerabilities that could impact trading functionality
2. **Performance:** Later Next.js versions include significant performance improvements for large applications
3. **Features:** Newer Server Actions and API route capabilities would benefit trading features
4. **Technical Debt:** Better to handle the migration now than accumulate more code to migrate later

### Implementation Timeline

#### Phase 1: Preparation (Current)
- Fix failing tests to ensure stable test baseline
- Document known security concerns
- Create migration branch for work

#### Phase 2: Migration (High Priority)
1. Create dedicated branch: `feature/next-15-migration`
2. Update Next.js to 15.x and associated React packages
3. Convert to App Router patterns if needed
4. Update API routes to new format
5. Fix component compatibility issues
6. Comprehensive testing of all components
7. Address all breaking changes

#### Phase 3: Post-Migration
1. Address any remaining security concerns
2. Clean up remaining dependencies
3. Leverage new Next.js features for trading functionality

## Dependency Cleanup Plan (Medium Priority)

1. Audit and consolidate @omnisat/lasereyes dependencies
2. Consider moving away from vite-plugin-ssr if not essential
3. Update axios across all nested dependencies

## Vulnerability Disclosure Protocol

1. Security issues should be reported to the OTORI security team
2. Regular security audits will be conducted
3. Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed immediately
4. Non-critical issues will be tracked and addressed in planned releases
